# Development Tools and Setup
This repository is to show and provide instructions on how to replicate my enviroment for my work PC.

### Composer
Always make sure that the **extension_dir** is unmarked and the openssl extension is enabled in the **php.ini** config.



### Backup
All my code is stored in Dropbox and synced between my iPad, iPhone, Laptop and Desktop. If I make a change on my desktop PC I can easily move to remote working on my laptop without any issues.
